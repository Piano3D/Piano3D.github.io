<p>As you may have seen, we have some Piano 3D development posts here (check <a href="/piano3d-development-diary-episode1">development diary episode 1</a>). This is second episode in which I add color-changing feature.</p>

<p>Of course, you are encouraged to comment what you think about changing color of the keyboard as well as Piano 3D app in general.</p>

As you may have seen, we have some Piano 3D development posts here (check [development diary episode 1](/piano3d-development-diary-episode1)). This is second episode in which I add color-changing feature.

Of course, you are encouraged to comment what you think about changing color of the keyboard as well as Piano 3D app in general.

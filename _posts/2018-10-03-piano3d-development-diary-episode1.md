I think it's fun to see how an applciation is created (haven't you seen Discovery's "How it is made?"), so here is a speeded up video of Piano 3D development. It shows extending the keyboard to 88 keys, modelling the first "A" key (it's shape is different) in blender and mixing everything together in Unity 3D and Visual Studio. But you don't have to understand everything here. Don't forget to subscribe to [Piano 3D youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9MOkgEEoZUGpnM8B3MsYeA).
